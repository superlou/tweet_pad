  <h2>What's a One-Time Pad?</h2>
  <p class='one-third'>
    One-time pads, when used correctly, allow for unbreakable encryption between parties.
    By physically exchanging a sequence of cryptographically random numbers, the message cannot
    be deciphered by anyone other than a party with the same sequence.
  </p>
  <p class='one-third'>
    This tool generates a pad for a message up to 140 characters.  In order to gaurantee that the pad cannot be recreated by an attacker, this entire application runs client-side, i.e. in local browser. You'll want to make sure you use a trusted computer.
  </p>
  <p class='one-third last'>
    A pad's only good if you share it with some friends, so you can download your random
    sequence as a PDF and print it out.  The printing template is compatable with {{#external-link href=paperLink}}Avery 5371{{/external-link}} business card paper for easy separation.
  </p>

  <div class="left">
    <h2><i class="fa fa-lock"></i> Encryption</h2>
    <p>
      Write-out your plaintext message.  You are restricted to the capital letters A through Z,
      a space character, and the symbols "#", "?", and ".".  To make your message more robust to
      decryption efforts, keep it as short as possible, and consider removing characters not
      critical to understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, starting with the first character in the message, shift it right/down on the character table by the first number on the one-time pad.  For the second plaintext character, shift it by the second number on the pad.  Continue on until you have fully encrypted your message.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can get really tedious, but take note that each row in the character table contains two sets of 5 characters each.  Moving down a row is a shift by 10.  Jumping from one group of 5 characters to the same position in the next is a shift by 5.  The following examples demonstrate how you can quickly encode the message characters "N" and "R" by 11 and 38 respectively.
    </p>

    <div id="examples">
      <img src='./example1.png' width=220 height=150>
      <img src='./example2.png' width=220 height=150>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="right">
    <h2><i class="fa fa-unlock"></i> Decryption</h2>
    <p>
      Follow the opposite procedure used to encrypt the message.  For the first character of the encrypted message, shift up/left on the character table by the first number on the one-time pad.  You can use the same jumps of 5 and 10 characters used in the encryption examples, but move in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you share multiple pads with the encrypting party, it may take a few tries to figure out which pad they are using.
